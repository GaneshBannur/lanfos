# *LanFOS* (*Lan*guage *F*ields for *O*pen-vocabulary *S*egmentation)

Open-vocabulary segmentation methods based on radiance fields are promising but their segmentation performance is lacking. Accurate segmentation is critical in enabling their use in downstream robotics tasks. Achieving better segmentation would allow them to replace 2D models and provide an both an accuracy and inference speed improvement. We present *LanFOS*, a radiance field-based open-vocabulary segmentation technique that improves the state-of-the-art segmentation performance.
